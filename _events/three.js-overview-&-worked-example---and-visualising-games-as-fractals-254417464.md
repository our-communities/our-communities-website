<p>The main session will be an overview of three.js, with a worked example demonstrating its use.</p> <p>There will also be a shorter talk by Ben Magistris on his work visualising games as fractals, mapping advantageous and disadvantageous positions after many turns, which leads to surprisingly detailed patterns. Here's an example: <a href='https://goo.gl/rkWRsT' class='linkified'>https://goo.gl/rkWRsT</a></p> <p>---</p> <p>Three.js is a popular library for creating 3D scenes in a browser.</p> <p>We're lucky to have our very own Carl Bateman lead an overview of three.js and also demonstrate using it with a real worked example.</p> <p>Three.js is one the more established javascript libraries for creating three-dimensional scenes in a browser without the need for additional software or plugins.</p> <p>Three.js has been used extensively for a wide range of works - from games to scientific data visualisation, from multimedia art experiences to educational tools for teaching, and even short animated films.</p> <p>You can find examples of what three.js can do at <a href='https://threejs.org/examples' class='linkified'>https://threejs.org/examples</a></p> <p>Carl will aim the introduction at beginners who may no have used a 3D library before. Having some coding background would be helpful, but not essential.</p> <p>He will then work through an interesting example, demonstrating the power of the algorithms and the three.js library.</p> <p>You can bring a laptop with wifi and a modern browser to follow along.</p> <p>--</p> <p>The talk begins at 7.00pm, and you can rrive from 6.30pm. A bar is available for refreshments, including free tea and coffee.</p> <p>Plese also sign up at the skillsmatter site: [link TBA]</p>
