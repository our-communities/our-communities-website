<P>Why language matters for gender equality (generally and for your business)? The aim of this workshop is to empower SMEs to recruit/attract more women to their companies or events, by ensuring they are not unconsciously sending out the wrong signals.</P>
<P>This workshop is facilitated by Lorna Dallas, Chair of <A HREF="https://winstemplymouth.org/" TARGET="_blank" REL="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Women in STEM Plymouth</A>. Don't miss out and book your place!</P>

<P>About WISP: </P>
<P>Women and girls are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) both in education and in the workplace. This is bad for everyone – not just women and girls – because it limits the diversity of ideas and perspectives in some of the most important, creative, and productive areas of our society.</P>
<P>Plymouth is no exception to this trend, and Women in STEM Plymouth (WISP) exists to try to change this. We aim to use the power of networking to increase the number of women in STEM roles in the Plymouth travel-to-work area, such that people of any gender are equally likely to work in these areas, at any level.</P>
<P>WISP is the local WISE Hub, but also work with other organisations locally, nationally and internationally to work towards our common goal of gender equality.</P>
