Why language matters for gender equality (generally and for your business)? The aim of this workshop is to empower SMEs to recruit/attract more women to their companies or events, by ensuring they are not unconsciously sending out the wrong signals.
This workshop is facilitated by Lorna Dallas, Chair of Women in STEM Plymouth. Don't miss out and book your place!
By the end of this session, you should be able to:


Understand that language can be a powerful barrier to women’s engagement with events, activities or jobs and give some examples of this.


Recognise the importance of using both verbs and adjectives when describing events, activities or jobs.


Recognise non-inclusive words in copy and come up with better alternatives.


Understand what imposter syndrome is and what effect it has on the impact of advertising.


Recognise sexist language and thus be empowered to stop it.



About WISP: 
Women and girls are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) both in education and in the workplace. This is bad for everyone – not just women and girls – because it limits the diversity of ideas and perspectives in some of the most important, creative, and productive areas of our society.
Plymouth is no exception to this trend, and Women in STEM Plymouth (WISP) exists to try to change this. We aim to use the power of networking to increase the number of women in STEM roles in the Plymouth travel-to-work area, such that people of any gender are equally likely to work in these areas, at any level.
WISP is the local WISE Hub, but also work with other organisations locally, nationally and internationally to work towards our common goal of gender equality.
