<p>This meetup will be in Cornwall, not London.</p> <p>----</p> <p>Colour is an important element of design and composition.</p> <p>In this beginner-friendly session we'll be learning about:</p> <p>* how colour is made on electronic displays like smartphones and monitors<br/>* mixing colours using the Red Green Blue (RGB) colour model<br/>* experiencing the limitation of the RGB colour model<br/>* learning about the Hue Saturation Brightness (HSB) colour model which overcomes those limits<br/>* simple colour theory - and using code to automate selecting colour palettes - eg analogous triples, split complementaries, and why red is not always the opposite of green!</p> <p>Despite the prevalence of the RGB colour model, many algorithmic artists prefer using the HSB colour model. By the end of this session I hope you'll also see why!</p> <p>Artists and new coders very welcome!</p> <p>----</p> <p>We'll be using the p5js / Processing coding language we've been learning about in previous sessions. Don't worry if you missed them, we'll go over the basics. You can catch up using the first few projects from this course; <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/creative-coding-for-kids/' class='linkified'>https://sites.google.com/view/creative-coding-for-kids/</a></p> <p>----</p> <p>Please bring a fully charged laptop with working wifi and a modern browser - you won't need to install anything else.</p> <p>We'll be starting at 6pm not 6.30pm. Parking is usually free in the council car parks at this time.</p>
