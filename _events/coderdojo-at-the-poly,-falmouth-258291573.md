<p>The eighth CoderDojo Cornwall.</p> <p>CoderDojo?</p> <p>Coding is an important skill in a world that is increasingly digital. Coding is also fun and creative!</p> <p>A CoderDojo is a fun and relaxed way to learn to code. And with code you can craft websites, build smartphone apps, make games, control robots and create beautiful art.</p> <p>CoderDojo is a world-wide network and you can find out more: <a href='https://coderdojo.com' class='linkified'>https://coderdojo.com</a></p> <p>Who Is It For?</p> <p>CoderDojo is for children aged 7 to 17 and is ideal for anyone who has never coded before or would like to learn in a relaxed and supportive group.</p> <p>Parents and guardians also find the sessions useful to help continue learning and experimenting outside the dojo.</p> <p>What Will We Do?</p> <p>Children will pick a small, bite-sized project to do in the dojo. These projects include a tutorial, opportunities to experiment and play, as well as make something interesting.</p> <p>At the end of the dojo there will be an opportunity to show what you've been working on and talk about your experience making it.</p> <p>Initially we will have projects on:</p> <p>* Scratch - a very gentle introduction to coding, perfect for younger coders<br/>* OpenProcessing - a beginner-friendly way to have fun creating art with code<br/>* Python - a very popular language that's also easy to learn, ideal for those progressing from first steps<br/>* Micro:bit - using Python or code blocks to control a BBC Micro:bit for fun hardware projects</p> <p>Some projects can be worked on in pairs or groups.</p> <p>As we grow we'll cover more of the different paths available, including making web pages. You can find out more here: <a href='https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo' class='linkified'>https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo</a></p> <p>Practical Stuff</p> <p>CoderDojo is FREE! There is no cost for attending and taking part.</p> <p>Please book tickets for each person attending, so 2 tickets for a parent and a child.</p> <p>Please bring a fully charged laptop for your child to use. In future we hope to have spare laptops for use in dojos. Some projects may require some software to be installed - we can help you in class.</p> <p>All children must be accompanied by a parent or guardian for the duration of the dojo.</p> <p>You can bring food and drink for your child, and you can take a break whenever you need to.</p> <p>We want to encourage children with additional needs - please get in touch if any preparation is required.</p> <p>You can contact the organiser at coderdojocornwall at gmail dot com.</p>
