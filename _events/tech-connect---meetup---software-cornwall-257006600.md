<p>Join the Software Cornwall community for our spring meetup at the Tremough Innovation Centre (TIC), Falmouth on February 7th. We’ll be gathering at TIC for a lunchtime filled with networking plus a handful of talks and workshops.</p> <p>During the networking time, we’ll be facilitating a skill swap activity, where we link up people and organisations who are looking to share or receive expertise. With so many different yet complementary skills amongst Software Cornwall’s 80+ members, there is a huge opportunity to increase collaboration within the counties tech community.</p> <p>Tickets are available via the link below. All tickets will include lunch and are complimentary for Software Cornwall members. Non-members are welcome to attend and are asked to buy a ticket for a nominal fee.</p> <p><a href='https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tech-connect-meetup-tickets-54659972449' class='linkified'>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tech-connect-meetup-tickets-54659972449</a></p> <p>By attending this event you are agreeing to follow our Code of Conduct. <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6zgRBG916d297u_GRUUVwJpQA10R5bclSrWN4RnguE/edit?usp=sharing' class='linkified'>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6zgRBG916d297u_GRUUVwJpQA10R5bclSrWN4RnguE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
