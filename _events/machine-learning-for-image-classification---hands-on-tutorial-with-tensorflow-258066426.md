<p>A beginner-friendly hands-on image machine learning for classification tutorial with Tensorflow.</p> <p>--</p> <p>In recent years there has been huge progress in machine vision and image classification, stuff previously only dreamt of in science fiction.<br/>We're lucky to have Barney Nicholls lead a beginner-friendly tutorial on image classification using Tensorflow.</p> <p>He'll briefly set out a business challenge that inspired him to look at image classification, before leading us gently through a simple worked example of training a Google Tensorflow neural network to recognise images, and then testing it. He'll weave in wisdom and insights into machine learning as we progress through the example.</p> <p>He'll also provide suggestions for how the simple solution could be improved, and point to modern alternative approaches to Tensorflow.</p> <p>This hands-on tutorial is for beginners and you don't need to have any previous experience with Tensorflow, machine learning or image classification.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Please bring a fully charged laptop with working wifi. We'll be using cloud services so you shouldn't need to install any additional software.</p>
