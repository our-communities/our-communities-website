<p>Presentation to be announced soon.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Every other month we get together for a presentation by one of our members.<br/>The presentations are in the Quaker House in Taunton. Knock on the window or ring the bell if the door's locked.</p> <p>If there is something you could present on let us know, we've a broad audience so anything would be interesting and doesn't need to be very in depth.</p>
