<p>In partnership with the STEM Learning network, Software Cornwall is pleased to be facilitating three days of training for the counties current and future STEM Ambassadors.</p> <p>STEM Ambassadors are volunteers from a wide range of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related jobs and disciplines across the UK. They offer their time and enthusiasm to help bring STEM subjects to life and demonstrate the value of them in life and careers.</p> <p>STEM Ambassadors and support from the network have been instrumental in the successful expansion of Software Cornwall's education outreach activities over the past 18 months. Theyâ€™ve assisted with our Mission to Mars program, Cornwall Tech Jams and supporting in school activities.</p> <p>These sessions are offered completely free and open to either existing ambassadors or those taking part in the induction session. To register your interest, complete this form. A member of the CSW group will be in touch to arrange your onboarding, and details of the rooms will be sent out in the days leading up to the activities.</p> <p>The four sessions running are:</p> <p>- Powerful Practicals<br/>- STEM Ambassador Induction<br/>- People Like Me<br/>- STEM Ambassador Mentoring</p> <p>Full details are available at <a href='https://www.softwarecornwall.org/stem-ambassador-training-jan-2019/' class='linkified'>https://www.softwarecornwall.org/stem-ambassador-training-jan-2019/</a></p> <p>By attending this event, you are agreeing to follow the Software Cornwall events Code of Conduct - <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6zgRBG916d297u_GRUUVwJpQA10R5bclSrWN4RnguE/edit?usp=sharing' class='linkified'>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6zgRBG916d297u_GRUUVwJpQA10R5bclSrWN4RnguE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
