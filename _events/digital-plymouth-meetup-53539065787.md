Digital Plymouth is back! And quicker than ever before! Join us on the 7th February for our first Meetup of 2019 with a pair of fantastic speakers.
Dr Lorna Dallas is a Safety Engineer by day and campaigner for gender equality by night. As a scientist, engineer, feminist and Chair of Women in STEM Plymouth, she has a unique skillset and a passion for making herself (and hopefully the world) better. She'll be talking about the importance of the 400 Women project and how you can get involved.
Lucy Knight is a balancing act on the geek/wonk interface with nearly two decades working in public sector data analysis, policy and data science with a side of open data and citizen science. She is currently Lead Data Scientist at the Food Standards Agency, registered trainer for the Open Data Institute and co-founder of ODI Devon and ThingsCamp and The Data Place. She'll be examining the expectations and misunderstandings around what it means to be a data scientist. Warning: May or may not contain actual unicorns.
Keep an eye on Facebook and Twitter for more details.


Digital Plymouth is supported by Bromhead Chartered Accountants. Tickets are limited so make sure to book yours now.
Digital Plymouth is possible thanks to Brilliant Working, Controlled Frenzy, Elixel, Loli, Super Socialise Me and THINQTANQ.
