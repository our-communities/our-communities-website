<p>Natural language is everywhere - from legal documents to tweets, from corporate emails to historic literature, from customer discussions to public inquiry reports. The ability to automatically extract insight from text is a powerful one.</p> <p>The challenge is that human language is hard to compute with as it was never designed to be consistent, precise and unambiguous - in fact, that's its beauty!</p> <p>We're very lucky to have Peter Conway of Hertzian lead a hands-on tutorial on simple natural language processing and sentiment analysis using Python - the leading programming language for data science.</p> <p>The tutorial is designed for newcomers to natural language processing (NLP) and is suitable for beginner programmers. Peter will introduce just enough Python as the tutorial proceeds.</p> <p>By the end of the tutorial you'll be able to analyse text for sentiment, as well as have a basic understanding of how sentiment analysis works.</p> <p>Bring a fully charged laptop with working wifi.</p> <p>You'll need Python installed with some common data science libraries installed - Anaconda Python is the recommended and simple way of doing this. <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/download/' class='linkified'>https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a></p> <p>The tutorial will start at 7.00pm. You can arrive from 6.30pm and the opportunity to meet other members of our community.</p>
