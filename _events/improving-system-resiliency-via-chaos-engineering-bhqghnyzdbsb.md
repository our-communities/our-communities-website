<p>Advances in Cloud technology means systems are becoming increasingly more distributed and complex. Large monoliths are being split up into microservices, we're depending on more remote services and Functions as a Service (FaaS)/Serverless are becoming increasingly common. The very nature of distributed systems mean they're far more prone to failures than similarly-scoped monoliths; this makes predicting or preventing possible failure modes increasingly more difficult.</p> <p>In this talk we'll look at how we harness Chaos Engineering, a discipline pioneered by Netflix, to better understand our systems, their failure modes and how we can use this information to improve system overall resiliency and reliability.</p> <p>Presented by Joe Woodward.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Every other month we get together for a presentation by one of our members.<br/>The presentations are in the Quaker House in Taunton. Knock on the window or ring the bell if the door's locked.</p> <p>If there is something you could present on let us know, we've a broad audience so anything would be interesting and doesn't need to be very in depth.</p>
