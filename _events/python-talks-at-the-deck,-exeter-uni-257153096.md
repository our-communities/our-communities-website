<p>Doors open at 18:30, talks start at 19:00</p> <p>Free parking (from 6pm) just below the venue</p> <p>First talk from Terry McCann on Getting Started with Python Machine Learning.<br/>Second talk from Pikakshi Manchanda on Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p> <p>Getting Started with Python Machine Learning</p> <p>Everyone needs to start learning machine learning, by 2020 80% of all applications will be powered by a form Artificial Intelligence (Machine learning - donâ€™t worry the robots are not rising). Machine learning is no longer just for data scientists, everyone working with data need to have a basic awareness of machine learning. If you work with data, you should be investing in machine learning.</p> <p>In this session we will look at Python as a language and explore its packages for interactive machine learning. Terms like SkLearn, Pandas, SciPy, Pickle will become familiar to you by the end of this session. You won't be an expert in machine learning but you will know how to get started with Python.</p> <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</p> <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) sits at the intersection of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics. From analysing sentiments to performing machine translation and conquering language barriers, scientists have become heavily focused on exploring ways to communicate human language with computers. Recent advances in the field of Machine Learning have increasingly influenced these explorations by enabling computers to do quite a lot of useful things with the natural language.</p> <p>In this session, we will have a look at various NLP applications and explore Python packages such as NLTK used to perform NLP tasks related to text pre-processsing, parsing, segmentation and so on which form the foundational steps required to implement NLP applications.</p>
