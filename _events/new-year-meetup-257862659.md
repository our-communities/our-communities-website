<p>Welcome to 2019! To kick this year off we have two great presentations for our meetup.</p> <p>Group co-organisers, Rahul, James and James from Headforwards will be giving an overview of the shiny new features in Visual Studio 2019, hopefully including a live demo of the Live Share feature between a Windows machine and a Mac.</p> <p>We'll then have pizza and a beer and finish the evening off with Barney Nicholls (also from Headforwards) showing us how to build a game you can control with your body using Unity and the Microsoft Kinect.</p> <p>Hopefully, it should be a fun start to the year and take our minds off the dark, cold, evenings.</p> <p>Headforwards are hosting us in their office at Cornwall College. We are in the Opie Building on the top floor. We'll start at 6pm, have pizzas around 6:40 and Barney will start around 7:10. We should be finished before 8pm.</p>
