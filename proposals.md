  <p>Submit a talk via the shared call for proposals for digital and tech
  communities in the South West. Our communities are always welcoming proposals
  that are of interest to the broader digital/tech community.</p>
  <p>By submitting a proposal via this form, you are agreeing to share your
  submission with the organisers of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Future Sync Events</li>
    <li>Tech Exeter</li>
    <li>Digital Plymouth</li>
    <li>Kernow DAT</li>
    <li>Digital Exeter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If an appropriate speaking opportunity arrises, individual organisers
  will get in touch directly. If they feel that a local community group might
  be a more suitable place to deliver your talk, they'll ask your permission before
  sharing the submission.</p>
  <p>NOTE: If you are submitting for a specific event or conference, please use
  the individual organisations call for proposals.</p>
