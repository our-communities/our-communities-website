What is FabLab Devon?

A small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication. It’s an open access, not-for-profit, community resource where anybody can invent and make just about anything.

What’s in a FabLab?

An evolving array of flexible computer controlled machines that allow you to invent, make and share. You could print t-shirts, produce electronic circuit boards, program a computer or CNC machine an electric guitar.
