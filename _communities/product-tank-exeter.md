ProductTank is a global network of meetups for product people, by product people,
and provides an opportunity for Product Managers in Exeter to exchange ideas and
experiences about Product Design, Development and Management, Business Modelling,
Metrics, User Experience and all the other things that get us excited.

Events include talks from guest speakers on topics around product management,
networking opportunities, and a good old-fashioned chin-wag over a beer or two.
