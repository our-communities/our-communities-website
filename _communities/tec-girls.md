TECgirls is a group for young girls (and their parents) to ignite a passion for technology, engineering and creativity through play, experimentation and exploring.

Aimed at girls 6-12 years old, these events will be packed with lots of fun and exciting activities for girls to play with. There is no requirement for any previous experience and there will be helpers and mentors to guide the girls and their parents through these activities.
