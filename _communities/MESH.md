MESH stands for Make – Explore – Socialise – Hack. They’re a Communiversity that
uses the power of local people to provide others with the opportunity to improve
and learn new skills.

MESH is also an incubator of projects (like Borrow Don’t Buy) that aim to help
develop Plymouth to its full potential.
