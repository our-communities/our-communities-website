Algorithmic Art is about maths and code making art.

The community is a diverse friendly place to share ideas, be inspired by each
other, show what you're working on, support each other with coding, and discuss
what art means to us as individuals.

The group hope to inspire artists to learn to code, technologists to explore art,
and first time coders to get started in fun way that stimulates the senses.
